- Local Variable Type Inference

	a. Local Variable Type Inference
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Java always needed explicit types on local variables.
	
	When writing and reading code, we always know which type we expect. 
	On the other hand, a lot of the code is just types with no usability.
	
	The var type allows us to omit type from the left-hand side of our statements.
	
		- Old Way
		-------------------
		Let us look into the example here. 
		We want to create small a set of people, 
		put everything in one list and then go through that list in the for loop to print out their name and last name:
		
		public class LocalTypeVar {
		
		    public void explicitTypes() {
		        Person Roland = new Person("Roland", "Deschain");
		        Person Susan = new Person("Susan", "Delgado");
		        Person Eddie = new Person("Eddie", "Dean");
		        Person Detta = new Person("Detta", "Walker");
		        Person Jake = new Person("Jake", "Chambers");
		
		        List<Person> persons =
		                List.of(Roland, Susan, Eddie, Detta, Jake);
		
		        for (Person person : persons) {
		            System.out.println(person.name + " - " + person.lastname);
		        }
		    }
		}
		This is the type of code that we can see in most cases in Java. 
		We use explicit types to make sure that we know what the method expects.
	
		- Implicit Typing with var
		-------------------
		Now, we will look into the same example, but using the var keyword that Java 10 introduced. 
		We still want to create several person objects and put them in a list. 
		After that, we will go through that list and print out the name of each person:
		
		public class LocalTypeVar {
		
		    public void varTypes() {
		        var Roland = new Person("Roland", "Deschain");
		        var Susan = new Person("Susan", "Delgado");
		        var Eddie = new Person("Eddie", "Dean");
		        var Detta = new Person("Detta", "Walker");
		        var Jake = new Person("Jake", "Chambers");
		
		        var persons = List.of(Roland, Susan, Eddie, Detta, Jake);
		
		        for (var person : persons) {
		            System.out.println(person.name + " - " + person.lastname);
		        }
		    }
		}
		We can see some of the most typical examples of using var type on local variables. 
		First, we use them for defining local variables. 
		It can be a standalone object or even a list with the diamond operator.
