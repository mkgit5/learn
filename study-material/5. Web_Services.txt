Web Services
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is REST?
	- REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style, 
	  by which data can be transmitted over transport protocol such as HTTP(S).

What is SOAP?
	- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a transport protocol for sending and receiving requests and responses on XML format, 
	  which can be used on top of transport protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, UDP, etc. 

What is WSDL?
	- WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML format for describing web services and how to access them.

What is JAX-WS?
 - JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services) is a set of APIs for creating web services in XML format.

What is JAXB?
	- JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) is a Java standard that defines 'how Java objects are converted from and to XML'. 
	- It makes reading and writing of XML via Java relatively easy.

What is RESTful web service?
	- RESTful Web Services are REST architecture based web services. 
	- In REST Architecture everything is a resource. 
	- RESTful web services are light weight, highly scalable and maintainable 
	  and are very commonly used to create APIs for web based applications.

What is difference between SOAP and restful?
	- REST works with resources
	  SOAP works with operations
	- REST supports different formats like text, JSON and XML; 
	  SOAP only supports XML;
	- REST works only over HTTP(S) on a transport layer; 
	  SOAP can be used with different protocols on a transport layer;
	- REST only supports SSL security;
	  SOAP supports SSL security and WS-security(Web Service-security); 
	- REST supports transactions, but it is neither ACID compliant nor can provide two phase commit.
	  SOAP supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability);

What are HTTP methods supported by REST?
	- GET
    - POST
    - PUT
    - DELETE
    - OPTIONS
    - HEAD

What is the difference between PUT (Idempotent) and POST (Non-Idempotent)?
	- PUT is idempotent, while POST is not. It means if we PUT an object twice, it has no effect.

What is WADL?
	- WADL (Web Application Description Language) is a XML description of a deployed RESTful web application. 

What are the information presented in WSDL?

How to download file in JAX-RS?
    - Java API for RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS)
    - Put @Produces(“?”) on service method, with a 'Response' return type. Instead “?” write a type text/plain, image/png, etc. 
    - Set “Content-Disposition” in Response header to tell browser to pop up a download box for user to download.
        @GET
        @Path("/get")
        @Produces("image/png")
        public Response getFile() {
            File file = new File(FILE_PATH);
            ResponseBuilder response = Response.ok((Object) file);
            response.header("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=image_from_server.png");
            return response.build();
        }
	
	- Spring controller
        @RequestMapping(value = "/stuff/{stuffId}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
        public ResponseEntity<InputStreamResource> downloadStuff(@PathVariable int stuffId) throws IOException {
            String fullPath = stuffService.figureOutFileNameFor(stuffId);
            File file = new File(fullPath);
            InputStreamResource isr = new InputStreamResource(new FileInputStream(file));
                        
            HttpHeaders respHeaders = new HttpHeaders();
            respHeaders.setContentType("application/pdf");
            respHeaders.setContentLength(12345678);
            respHeaders.setContentDispositionFormData("attachment", "fileNameIwant.pdf");

            return new ResponseEntity<InputStreamResource>(isr, respHeaders, HttpStatus.OK);
        }

How to implement service versioning in REST services?
	- Common way to implement API versioning is to embed the version number in the API URLs.
	  For eg: Either in the domain (i.e. apiv1.example.com/resource) or in the resource path (api.example.com/v1/resource)
	- Another way is to put the version number in the HTTP request headers. 
	  For Eg: This is typically done through the Accept header:
		// via a parameter
		Accept: application/json; version=v1
		// via a vendor content type
		Accept: application/vnd.company.myapp-v1+json
	
	Note: We can define your own media types using either the 
		  a. “vendor tree” (i.e. “application/vnd.example.resource-v1+json”) or 
		  b. “Unregistered x. Tree” (i.e. “application/x.example.resource-v1+json”), to avoid registration requirements

What is the difference between AJAX and REST?
    - In Ajax, the request are sent to the server by using 'XMLHttpRequest objects'; 
      REST have a URL structure and a request/response pattern that revolve around the use of resources;
	- Ajax eliminates the interaction between the customer and server asynchronously; 
	  REST requires the interaction between the customer and server;
	- Ajax is a set of technology; 
	  REST is a type of software architecture and a method for users to request data or information from servers.
