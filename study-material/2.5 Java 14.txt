- Switch Expressions

	a. Switch Expressions
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Switch expressions allowed us to omit break calls inside every case block. It helps with the readability of the code and better understanding.

	In this section, we will see several ways of how to use switch expressions.
	
		- Old Way of Switch Statements
		-------------------
		We have a method where a client provides the desired month, and we return the number of days inside that month.
		
		The first thing that comes to our mind is to build it with switch-case statements:
		
		public class SwitchExpression {
		
		    public static void main(String[] args) {
		        int days = 0;
		        Month month = Month.APRIL;
		
		        switch (month) {
		            case JANUARY, MARCH, MAY, JULY, AUGUST, OCTOBER, DECEMBER :
		                days = 31;
		                break;
		            case FEBRUARY :
		                days = 28;
		                break;
		            case APRIL, JUNE, SEPTEMBER, NOVEMBER :
		                days = 30;
		                break;
		            default:
		                throw new IllegalStateException();
		        }
		    }
		}
		We need to make sure that we put a break statement inside our case code block. Failing it will result in checking on other conditions after we match the first one.
		
		- Using Switch Expressions
		-------------------
		We will look into the same method as before. The user wants to send the month and get the number of days in that month:
		
		public class SwitchExpression {
		
		    public static void main(String[] args) {
		        int days = 0;
		        Month month = Month.APRIL;
		
		        days = switch (month) {
		            case JANUARY, MARCH, MAY, JULY, AUGUST, OCTOBER, DECEMBER -> 31;
		            case FEBRUARY -> 28;
		            case APRIL, JUNE, SEPTEMBER, NOVEMBER -> 30;
		            default -> throw new IllegalStateException();
		        };
		    }
		}
		We are using a bit different notation in the case block. We are using -> instead of the colon. Even though we are not invoking the break statement, we will still jump out of the switch statement on the first valid condition.
		
		This will do the same thing as the code shown in the previous example.
		
		- The yield Keyword
		-------------------
		The logic inside the case block can be a bit more complicated than just returning a value. For example, we want to log which month the user sent us:
		
		public class SwitchExpression {
		
		    public static void main(String[] args) {
		        int days = 0;
		        Month month = Month.APRIL;
		
		        days = switch (month) {
		            case JANUARY, MARCH, MAY, JULY, AUGUST, OCTOBER, DECEMBER -> {
		                System.out.println(month);
		                yield 31;
		            }
		            case FEBRUARY -> {
		                System.out.println(month);
		                yield 28;
		            }
		            case APRIL, JUNE, SEPTEMBER, NOVEMBER -> {
		                System.out.println(month);
		                yield 30;
		            }
		            default -> throw new IllegalStateException();
		        };
		    }
		}
		In a multi-line code block, we have to use the yield keyword to return a value from a case block.
