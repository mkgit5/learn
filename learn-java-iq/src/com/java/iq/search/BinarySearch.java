/*
 * A binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a specified value (the input "key") 
 * within a sorted array. 
 * In each step, the algorithm compares the input key value with the key value of the middle element of the array. 
 * If the keys match, then a matching element has been found so its index, or position, is returned. 
 * Otherwise, if the sought key is less than the middle element's key, then the algorithm repeats its action on 
 * the sub-array to the left of the middle element or, if the input key is greater, on the sub-array to the right.
 * If the remaining array to be searched is reduced to zero, then the key cannot be found in the array and a special 
 * "Not found" indication is returned.
 * Every iteration eliminates half of the remaining possibilities. This makes binary searches very efficient - even 
 * for large collections.
 * 
 * Binary search requires a sorted collection. 
 * Also, binary searching can only be applied to a collection that allows random access (indexing).
 * 
 * Performance:
 * Best : O(1)
 * Worst: O(log n) = n, n/2, n/4
 * 
 * What is O(log n)?
 * Basically means time goes up linearly while the n goes up exponentially. 
 * So if it takes 1 second to compute 10 elements, 
 * it takes 2 seconds to compute 100 elements, 
 * 3 seconds to compute 1000 elements, and so on. â€‹
 * It is O(log n) when we do divide and conquer type of algorithms e.g binary search.
